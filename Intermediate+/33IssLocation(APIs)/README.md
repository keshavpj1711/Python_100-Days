# APIs

## What are APIs?

API or Application Programming Interface is a software that helps two applications to communicate with each other.
Think of it like a messanger. With the help of APIs you can only request for the data that is provided.\
It's like if you are sitting in a restaurant then the API is your menu you can only order the food from the menu, 
you just can't rush into the kitchen and take anything you want.

# HTTP Codes 

When accessing the info on the web, you can actually see what is going on or what are the results of your query. These results are represented by Status Codes: 

- 1XX - Hold On something is going on 
- 2XX - Everything successful
- 3XX - You don't have the req permissions 
- 4XX - You made a mistake in accessing something thats not there 
- 5XX - The Server screwed up 

For eg: 404 is the most common you might have encountered when accessing pages that are not present.
