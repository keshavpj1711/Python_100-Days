# HTTP Requests

Uptill now we have only used GET HTTP Requests. 
But other than this we have some requests as well:

- GET - requests.get()
    - getting some data from external service
- POST - requests.post()
    - posting some stuff on external service eg: sheets, twitter
- PUT - requests.put()
    - updating some existing piece of data on above mentioned servies 
- DELETE - requests.delete()
    - does as the name suggests

Huh! well the syntax didn't change that much
