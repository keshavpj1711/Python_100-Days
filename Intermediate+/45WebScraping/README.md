# Web Scraping 

Looking through the underlying HTML code to scrape the info that we want. 
There can be many reason do so:

- The website does not have an api.
- We want to analyze some stuff about the website.
- Just to monitor for certain changes or things in the website.
- Or just to get data for ourself.

In python this is done using **Beautiful Soup**
