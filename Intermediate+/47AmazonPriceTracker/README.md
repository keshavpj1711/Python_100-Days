# Future of this project 

So i plan onto to actually deploy this script but before that somethings need to be changed: 

- A file thing is to be introduced where it stores about the products which are to looked for
- Next it should have a functionality to modify that file, basically modify our list
- The file best suited for this would be json i guess but i will look into that later
- The program has to made more modular rather than just being all in one main.py
- Up to this point these are the points under consideration. ;)
