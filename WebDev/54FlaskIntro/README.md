# Library vs Framework

## Libraries vs. Frameworks: A Detailed Comparison

Choosing the right tool for your project is crucial. Both libraries and frameworks offer code reusability and a faster development process, but they cater to different needs. Here's a detailed breakdown of their key differences:

| Feature                   | Library                                     | Framework                                        |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Control Flow**          | You control the flow of your application.   | Framework dictates the overall flow.             |
| **Focus**                 | Provides specific functionality for a task. | Provides a broader structure for applications.   |
| **Flexibility**           | More flexible, can be used independently.   | Less flexible, tightly integrated with app.      |
| **Learning Curve**        | Lower learning curve (modular approach).    | Steeper learning curve (structure & patterns).   |
| **Dependency Management** | Often managed by you (e.g., npm, yarn).     | Often managed by the framework itself.           |
| **Community & Support**   | Varied depending on the library.            | Large and active communities.                    |
| **Customization**         | Highly customizable with minimal overhead.  | Less customizable, relies on framework patterns. |
| **Testing**               | Easier to test in isolation.                | May require framework-specific testing tools.    |
