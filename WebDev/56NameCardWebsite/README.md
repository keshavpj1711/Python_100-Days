# Rendering html templates and other static files 

To render html files all the html templates that need to be rendered are to be stored in a directory called `./templates`.\

And to store all the static files like `image.png` or `style.css` will be stored in `./static` directory.

For reference here's how the tree structure will look like:
```bash
.
├── app.py
├── static
│   ├── image.png
│   └── style.css
└── templates
    └── index.html
```

And i won't be covering the creating a Name Card as it's way too basic html that needs to be covered.
