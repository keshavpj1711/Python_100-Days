- Note there are two files to this project.
  - 1 - Which stores all the lists of letters, symbols and numbers which are to be used.
  - 2 - Which handles main execution of prog.
- This project uses list of letters, symbols and numbers already provided.
- It then takes the input of number of each character to be used how many number of times.
- Then all the characters are appended to an empty string.
