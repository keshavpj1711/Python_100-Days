# Today's Achievement
- Today I built a program that encodes and decodes the famous **CAESAR CIPHER**.
- I did not follow the teacher completely instead I took a different approach in overall flow of the program.
- This program had a lot of areas where we can do silly mistakes
- The new functions that I learnt about were **index()** and **math.ceil()**.
- For past two days I feel really comfortable dividing my final program into multiple files.
- After today's task I felt really good because :
  - I actually found out myself that writing down the flow of code helps in better understanding.
  - Sitting and solving by yourself is a better way to tackle.
