# Today's Achievement 
- This day was dedicated to learn about **creating classes** and concepts like **constructors**
- According to me this day was on the harder side to complete compared to other days
- The example chosen for the project could have been better as it made things complex
- But as we completed the further modules, the concepts became clear
