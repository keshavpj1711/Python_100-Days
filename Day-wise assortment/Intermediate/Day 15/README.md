# Today's Achievement
- This program helped me get comfortable with dictionaries as I didn't feel comfortable working with them.
- I also fell more comfortable creating functions and using them rather than just writing the code directly in the main program.
- As I was writing the code to this program, I felt that I am actually using standardized variables instead of numbers like in case of accessing the amount of milk latte uses:
    - I didn't use like `resources["milk"] < 150` instead I used `resources["milk"] < MENU["latte"]["cost"]` now you might think why I used this?
    - Its because even that this statement may seem long, but if we change the amount of milk used in making latte in the dictionary, we donâ€™t have to make change to our statement.
- Other than that, it was a fun project to do and taught me a lot.
