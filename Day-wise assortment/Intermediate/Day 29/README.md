# Password Manager

This project was very simple, main motive behind this project was:

- To practice file management with GUI programs.
- To work with dialogue boxes and pop-ups.

Even though the project may not be so useful at this point, but this can actually be worked on to get the desired results.

## Saving the details

- After setting up the UI the first thing that we did was add the save details functionality
- This was easily achieved by appending the entries to the created txt file.
- After this we cleared the entries using `entry.delete(starting_index, end_index)`

## Working with dialogue boxes and pop-ups

- In tkinter to work with dialogue boxes and pop-ups we have a module known as messagebox
- One thing to note is that this module is not a part of any class so to use this we have to import it separately.
  - Even if you have done this `from tkinter import *` still you have to separately import it
- To know how messagebox works see here - [Link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.messagebox.html)
