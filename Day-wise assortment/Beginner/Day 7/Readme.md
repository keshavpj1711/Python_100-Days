# Today's Achievement
- Today the course was all about learning to structure your program.
- We can easily structure our programs using flowcharts.
- The code that i wrote today is filled up with comments to easily understand the code.
- Externally i also read about how to:
  - Convert a simple list of letters to a single string with the help of **join() function**
  - Print several things in same line by different print command using **end=**
- By default, all the print statements are print(something, end = "\n")
