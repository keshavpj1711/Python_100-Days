# Workout Tracker on Google Sheets

## What I have used 

There are quite a few things I will use for this and these will grow with the project increasing in size,
but as of now the things currently in use are: 

- Nutritionix API:
    - To actually get our user input from natural eng language and get appropriate conclusions from the input.

- Sheety:
    - This is a tool with which you can actually incorporate your google sheets with api so that you can do all the stuff like:
        - adding a row
        - editing a row
        - getting the data in sheet
        - deleting a row

I know initially sheety comes with a lot of limitations but i will further improve this project by using Google Sheets API
Till that it is what it is....
